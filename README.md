By Giovanni Noè
University of Milan Bicocca – Cybersecurity for Data Science Course


This project investigates the capability of some data poisoning attacks to reduce the performance of a VGG-like CNN architecture.
The dataset used is CIFAR-10 available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.


The project folder is organized into the following content:
  - Cyber_Project.ipynb containing the script of the project
  - Data Poisoning Attacks on Image Classifiers.pdf the report of the project

After the data are downloaded from the link above and souce directories are correclty set in the notebook, the code can be run to reproduce the results of this work.
